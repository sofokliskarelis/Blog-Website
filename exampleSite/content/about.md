Hello to everyone I am currently enrolled in a Bsc Computer Science program and I am looking to become a cyber security engineer. I have always been interested in computers and technology, and I believe that this field will allow me to use my skills to protect people and businesses from online threats. I am passionate about keeping people safe online, and I believe that becoming a cyber security engineer will allow me to make a difference in the world.

There is no one specific path to becoming a cyber security engineer, but studying to build strong foundations in computer science and engineering is a great place to start. With a solid understanding of how systems work and how to protect them from threats, you will be well-positioned to enter this growing field.Additionally, keeping up with the latest news and developments in cyber security will help you stay ahead of the curve.

In my free time i love hiking with my friends and of course when the weather is rainy or too cold i spend my time training for my career on TryHackMe by doing CTF's or by going through their lessons expanding my knowledge.
