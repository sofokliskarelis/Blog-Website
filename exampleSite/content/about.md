My name is Sofoklis and I am currently enrolled in a Bsc Computer Science program. I am looking to become a cyber security engineer because I have always been interested in computers and technology. I believe that this field will allow me to use my skills to protect people and businesses from online threats.

I am passionate about keeping people safe online, and I believe that becoming a cyber security engineer will allow me to make a difference in the world. There is no one specific path to becoming a cyber security engineer, but studying computer science and engineering is a great place to start. With a solid understanding of how systems work and how they can be protected from threats, i will be well-positioned for success in this growing field. Additionally, keeping up with the latest news and developments in cyber security will help you stay ahead of the curve."

In my free time, I love hiking with my friends. Of course, when the weather is rainy or too cold, I spend my time training for my career on TryHackMe by doing CTFs or by going through their lessons expanding my knowledge. By doing this, not only am I able to improve myself professionally but also have some fun and socialize with friends at the same time.
