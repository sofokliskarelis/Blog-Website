IP stands for Internet Protocol. It is the primary protocol that handles communication on the internet. It is responsible for routing data packets between devices on a network. There are two types of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6.

IPv4 is the most common type of IP address in use today. It consists of four sets of numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by periods (e.g., 192.168 . 1 . 1). An IPv4 address can be assigned to any device connected to a network that uses this protocol (e . g., computers, printers, routers). An advantage of using an IPv4 address is that it's relatively easy to remember since it's not as long as an IPv6 address

which can be up 128 bits long ( e . g., 2001 : 0db8 : 85a3 : 0000:0000: 8a2e:0370: 7334). A disadvantage of using an

Ipv4 address is that there are only about 4 billion unique addresses available while there are over 340 trillion possible

combinations with Ipv6
