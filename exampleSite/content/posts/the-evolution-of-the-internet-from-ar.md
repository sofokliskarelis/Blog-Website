The Internet is one giant network that consists of many small networks within itself. Its first iteration was within the ARPANET project in the late 1960s,which was funded by the United States Defence Department. This project documented the first actionable network, but it wasn't until 1989 when Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (WWW) that the Internet as we know it today came to be. The WWW allowed for information to be shared and accessed globally at unprecedented speeds, laying down the foundation for how we use and rely on the Internet today.
