Networks are a key part of our lives, both personal and professional. They provide us with the ability to connect with others and share information. But what exactly is a network?

At its simplest, a network is just two or more things connected together. For example, your friendship circle is a network because you are all connected by similar interests, hobbies, skills and so on. But more specifically in computing terms, networking refers to the way that devices such as computers communicate with each other using rules known as protocols.

There are many different types of networks ranging from small home networks connecting just a few devices to large scale enterprise networks spanning the globe. The most common type of home network uses WiFi technology to wirelessly connect devices such as laptops, smartphones and tablets to the internet and each other. Businesses usually have wired Ethernet networks which offer greater speeds and reliability than WiFi but require physical cabling between devices.

The protocols that govern how computer networks function are essential for ensuring that data can be sent reliably from one device to another without error
